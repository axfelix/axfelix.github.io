hi, I'm Alex! I'm a digital preservation / research data management technologist and librarian at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.

here is some work I'm proud of:

- I maintain the [harvester codebase](https://github.com/axfelix/frdr_harvest) for [FRDR](https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/), a Canadian national data portal, with Todd Trann and Kelly Stathis.

- I'm currently leading a project to implement usable, lightweight zero-knowledge [encryption](https://github.com/jza201/frdr-secure-data) of sensitive data for repository deposit, using Hashicorp's [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) platform, with Jin Zhang.

- I wrote the [desktop client](https://github.com/usask-rc/radiam-agent-releases/releases), which uses Electron and Python packed into a single binary for both GUI and CLI usage, for an indexer tool we developed called [Radiam](https://radiam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), with my colleague Yang Zhou.

- I used this same approach to make a user-friendly desktop GUI for preparing BagIt packages for deposit to our local repositories, called [MoveIt](https://github.com/axfelix/moveit-electron), inspired by earlier work done by Mark Jordan; I'm working on a companion app intended to replace the deprecated [bagger](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagger) project, which I'm calling [ProveIt](https://github.com/axfelix/dragbag).

- I only blog when I get annoyed enough about being the only one in the world to have a particular problem; recently, this included [using CUDA under bash on Windows](cuda.md), which will happily [soon become unnecessary](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21263377/microsoft-windows-10-linux-gui-apps-gpu-acceleration-wsl-features).

- I previously wrote up a solution for [handling lossy video in Archivematica](ffv1.md), which is also now happily obsolete as related work has been upstreamed.

- I don't like when there's a big gap between what I can do with shell scripts and what other people can do more easily so I made an OCR app called [ochre](https://github.com/axfelix/ochre).

- I've spent more time than I tend to remember dealing with retro computing and emulation of all kinds; I like [original hardware](macs.jpg) but I'm no purist.

- I keep a [complete-ish academic CV](agarnett.pdf); I've written recently about [the use of ZFS-likes in memory institutions](papers/ipres18.pdf) and [WYSIWYG XML editors for academic publishing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425544/).

- I produced an irregular podcast with my friend [Nic Weber](http://nicweber.info/) called [Success is Stupid](sis1.mp3) (currently on hiatus, waiting for a good turnkey solution to self-host the archives).

- I married [Justyna Berzowska](http://ambientstructures.ca/), who is a content strategist and user researcher that you should hire!

- I love experimental videogames and I will shill for *Oikospiel*, *10 Beautiful Postcards*, *Astrologaster*, *Elsinore*, *Mirror Drop*, and many others. I [tell you all the time](https://lana.whosyourdad.de) (inspired by [Holly Gramazio](https://twitter.com/hollygramazio/status/1211703711275327489), desktop-only).

- Along similar lines, I'm an enthusiastic script doctor, though I can get [sidetracked](https://youtu.be/gbFlO9WrojU) (download my patch [here](sft.vcdiff) or [here](sftr.vcdiff) depending on your copy of the game).

- I developed an [interactive fiction game](kinski.html) about the Suez Canal starring Klaus Kinski, because if that doesn't shout "huge audience" I don't know what would.

- [Does it beep?](https://doesitbeep.com) I hope it doesn't beep.

- I run a few instances of [open source](https://dukakis.ca) [replacements](https://gathio.dukakis.ca) for hosted services, mostly for local folks, just to make Facebook that little bit less unavoidable.

- For many years I've also run what is in hindsight an [idealized example](https://selectbutton.net) of an Intentionally Small Social Network as outlined in [runyourown.social](https://runyourown.social/). Fair warning, you have to squint to see the best practices.

- [Who's your dad.de](http://whosyourdad.de/)? I think I inadvertently stole the name for this project from [demi adejuyigbe](https://twitter.com/electrolemon/status/1182047291084959744?lang=en).

- I made [the potable february](https://twitter.com/potablefebruary), a bot that keeps David Berman in my life.

- I also made a [much stupider bot](https://twitter.com/WifeProblem) by training GPT-2 on a corpus of Rodney Dangerfield, Don Rickles, and Borat, with help from Zach Foote. [(talk)](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/716588929?t=0h17m39s)

- In early 2021, I was at the Recurse Center, and (contrary to my stated reluctance) [I](blagg/21-1-6.md) [blogged](blagg/21-1-8.md) [intermittently](blagg/21-1-13.md) [as](blagg/21-1-19.md) [I](blagg/21-1-25.md) [went](blagg/21-1-29.md) [along](blagg/21-2-4.md). While at Recurse, I made [putz](https://pypi.org/project/putz/), [the Does it Beep browser extension](https://github.com/axfelix/doesitbeep-ext), [Fart Map](https://usa.whosyourdad.de), [Eggs and Milk Minder 1.0c](https://github.com/axfelix/eggsandmilk), [To Bezier is Human](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=41217), [ffmpeg on Ice](https://ffmpeg-on-ice.herokuapp.com/), and other experiments.

- I once got upset about gentrification and wrote a [spooky story](homecoming.html) that doesn't have very much to do with gentrification.

- I contributed a little personal history to Ashley Blewer's [Internet Girlfriend Club](https://internetgirlfriend.club/volume9/3.html).

- I also write [movie](https://letterboxd.com/cremaster6/film/ishtar/) and [book reviews](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3547539425) because I can't help myself.

- I do my best to [reconcile](https://corona.whosyourdad.de/) myself to America in difficult times (warning: potentially upsetting imagery, desktop-only).

- I [built a tower tumbling through your HVAC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4eSU1dNJA0).

I [tweet](https://twitter.com/axfelix) too much, and am comforted that I can be so full of shit in my less-professional life in part because I am a member of the SFU Faculty Association. I would love to agitate for you to have a collective bargaining union of your own if you don't already.
