hi, I'm Alex! here is some work I'm proud of:

- I'm currently doing DevRel at Bluesky! You can find other work on my [resume](agarnett-resume.pdf).

- I'm a frequent speaker at [Write the Docs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p6LttjaSNM), one of my very favorite conferences.

- I previously edited and [contributed](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-video-streaming-server-using-nginx-rtmp-on-ubuntu-20-04) [several](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-squid-proxy-on-ubuntu-20-04) [tutorials](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-to-kubernetes-using-argo-cd-and-gitops) to DigitalOcean.

- I created the [harvester codebase](https://github.com/axfelix/frdr_harvest) for [FRDR](https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/), a Canadian national data portal, with Todd Trann and Kelly Stathis.

- I led a project to implement usable, lightweight zero-knowledge [encryption](https://github.com/jza201/frdr-secure-data) of sensitive data for repository deposit, using Hashicorp's [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) platform, with Jin Zhang.

- I only blog when I get annoyed enough about being the only one in the world to have a particular problem; recently, this included [using CUDA under bash on Windows](cuda.md), which will happily [soon become unnecessary](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21263377/microsoft-windows-10-linux-gui-apps-gpu-acceleration-wsl-features).

- I previously wrote up a solution for [handling lossy video in Archivematica](ffv1.md), which is also now happily obsolete as related work has been upstreamed.

- I don't like when there's a big gap between what I can do with shell scripts and what other people can do more easily so I made an OCR app called [ochre](https://github.com/axfelix/ochre).

- I worked with the Software Preservation Network on creating the first draft of their [Reference Guide to Emulation](https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/an-overview-of-emulation-as-a-preservation-method/).

- I've spent more time than I tend to remember dealing with retro computing and emulation of all kinds; I like [original hardware](macs.jpg) but I'm no purist.

- In an academic context, I've written about [the use of ZFS-likes in memory institutions](papers/ipres18.pdf) and [WYSIWYG XML editors for academic publishing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425544/).

- I developed an [interactive fiction game](kinski.html) about the Suez Canal starring Klaus Kinski, because if that doesn't shout "huge audience" I don't know what would.

- [Does it beep?](https://doesitbeep.com) I hope it doesn't beep.

- [Who's your dad.de](http://whosyourdad.de/)? I think I inadvertently stole the name for this project from [demi adejuyigbe](https://twitter.com/electrolemon/status/1182047291084959744?lang=en).

- I made [the potable february](https://twitter.com/potablefebruary), a bot that keeps David Berman in my life.

- I also made a [much stupider bot](https://twitter.com/WifeProblem) by training GPT-2 on a corpus of Rodney Dangerfield, Don Rickles, and Borat, with help from Zach Foote. [(talk)](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/716588929?t=0h17m39s)

- In early 2021, I was at the Recurse Center, where I made [putz](https://pypi.org/project/putz/), [the Does it Beep browser extension](https://github.com/axfelix/doesitbeep-ext), [Eggs and Milk Minder 1.0c](https://github.com/axfelix/eggsandmilk), [To Bezier is Human](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=41217), [ffmpeg on Ice](https://github.com/axfelix/ffmpegOnIce), and other experiments.

- I [built a tower tumbling through your HVAC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4eSU1dNJA0).

I [post](http://axfelix.bsky.social/) too much.
